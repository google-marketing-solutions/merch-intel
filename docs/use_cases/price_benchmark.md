## Details

This section provides **insights into your product pricing compared to market
benchmarks**, allowing you to identify opportunities for improvement. You can
filter specifically for disapproved products and drill down further by brand,
category, or custom label to pinpoint areas needing attention.

## Suggested actions

1.  Merchandising teams can leverage the price benchmark comparison to develop a
    more informed and competitive pricing strategy.
2.  Prioritize reactivating disapproved products that are priced competitively
    (at or below the benchmark), to capitalize on existing demand and improve
    product visibility.
